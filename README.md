# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 problems in a variety of languages.

## Possible languages

While I'd like to do different languages per day it seems likely that the exercises will build upon each other and so this plan is only so I can track what languages I'd like to try over the course of the AOC. Less interesting languages (C, Java...) will likely drop for more interesting ones in the event that I'd like to reuse code.
