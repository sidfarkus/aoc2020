# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 problems.  It is unlikely there will be both complete solutions for all problems and they are likely to stress brevity versus computational complexity (speed).  I hope to have solutions written in a few different languages but it is unlikely I will do all of the days completely.

## Possible languages

While I'd like to do different languages per day it seems likely that the exercises will build upon each other and so this plan is only so I can track what languages I'd like to try over the course of the AOC.

| Day  | Language attempt | Done |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---- |
| 1    | Ruby             | ✔️    |
| 2    | Go               | ✔️    |
| 3    | Clojure          | ✔️    |

| 7    | Scala            | ✔️    |
| 8    | C#               | ✔️    |
| 9    | Nim              | ✔️    |
| 10   | Powershell       |      |
| 11   | Python           |      |
